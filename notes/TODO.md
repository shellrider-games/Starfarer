This document is a loose list of near-term features we'd like to add (or bugs that need fixing).

Longer-term features can stay in DESIGNDOCUMENT or IDEAS.

- Shipyard tab: don't offer systems your ship already has.
- Add more ship types (including updating Freighter and Falcon).  Include some smaller ships, as Robin is really a mid-game ship.
- Shipyard tab: offer ships for sale (include trade-in value of current ship).
- Market tab: add price indicators for how cheap/expensive each commodity is compared to neighboring systems.

With the above features, you'll be able to start in a small ship, trade and explore to earn money, then upgrade to bigger ships.
