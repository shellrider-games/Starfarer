This document is a loose list of near-term features we'd like to add (or bugs that need fixing).

Longer-term features can stay in DESIGNDOCUMENT or IDEAS.

## Features

- Shipyard tab: don't offer systems your ship already has.
- Add more ship types (including updating Freighter and Falcon).
- Shipyard tab: offer ships for sale (include trade-in value of current ship).
- Ship: when a cargo item is sold, put some kind of overlay on the crate so it's clear this one has already been sold (until a crewman can grab it and put it off the ship).
- Show which crewman is selected, both in the floating crew list, and with some (temporary) highlight of their avatar.
- Add random available crewmen for hire, appearing in the cantinas.  For now, this can have just an up-front cost (recurring crew expenses can come later).
 
With the above features, you'll be able to start in a small (Wren) ship, trade and explore to earn money, then upgrade to bigger ships.



## Bugs

- Sometimes when I tell my crewman to place a crate down on the right side of the ship, he starts to do it, then changes his mind and plops it down in the left cargo hold instead.  Haven't quite pinned down the circumstances but it seems easy to reproduce.
- When I have two crewmembers and sell something, both crewmen try to go get it and put it out the airlock.  They should coordinate better (one crewman "claim" the task, and nobody else tries to do it).
- If you click a doors "Open All" or "Close All" control button, it _also_ moves the targeting reticle (into empty space!).
- Encounters happen too quickly back to back.  There should always be at least a little bit of flight (a second or so of real time) between encounters.
