# Starfarer

**Starfarer** is a space combat/trading game inspired by _FTL_ and a long history of space trading games going all the way back to classic Mac days (and probably earlier).

In this game, you command a spaceship, flying from system to system buying and selling goods.  But the spacelines are not always safe!  You may run into pirates, or authorities looking for contraband cargo.  Or you may decide to _be_ a pirate, preying on the fat freighters.  On your travels, you'll encounter strange characters and pick up odd jobs.  Some will be simple delivery missions... others may impact the fate of the galaxy.

## Status

Starfarer is early in development.  It's playable, but just barely.  See the [Design Document](notes/DESIGNDOCUMENT.md), [Ideas](notes/IDEAS.md) and [To-Do List](notes/TODO.md).

## How to Play

You can play a (possibly stale) build of it online here: https://shellrider.itch.io/starfarer

To play on your local desktop machine, download [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro), clone this repo, and mount the "user" folder in the top disk slot.  Then `reboot` Mini Micro to play the game.

Quick gameplay tips:

- Buy and sell goods on the Market tab.  Prices are shown along with how those prices compare to the galactic average, so you can recognize a good deal.

- Your crew should automatically stow cargo when it's bought, and also shove it out the airlock when it's sold.

- Use the Nav button to view the starmap, and travel between systems.  Note that a hyperjump can't be executed too close to a system, so you will have some sublight travel on either end of the jump.  You may encounter other ships in that time.

- If it comes to combat, power up your weapons and shields, if you have any!  Space combat isn't like _Star Wars_; it's a slow, methodical affair, as the weapons take some time to power up before they can fire.

- If you don't have any weapons, or you just don't want to fight, click Flee.  (Enjoy the ease of your escape; this will get harder as the game develops!)
